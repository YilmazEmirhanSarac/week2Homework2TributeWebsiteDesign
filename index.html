            <p>John Ronald Reuel Tolkien (January 3, 1892 – September 2, 1973) was an English writer, poet, philologist, and academic. He is renowned for his works of fantasy literature, such as The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. From 1925 to 1945, Tolkien served as the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford University and was a Fellow of Pembroke College. Later, he held the position of Merton Professor of English Language and Literature and was a Fellow of Merton College at the same university from 1945 until his retirement in 1959. Tolkien was a close friend of C. S. Lewis, a fellow member of The Inklings, an informal literary discussion group. On March 28, 1972, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II.</p>

            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>After being discharged from the army and leaving military service following World War I on November 3, 1920, Tolkien took his first civilian job, researching the history and etymology of Germanic-origin words for the Oxford English Dictionary. He later became a reader in English at the University of Leeds, earning the title of the youngest professor there. During this time, he prepared academic editions of works such as the Middle English Vocabulary and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. He also translated works like Sir Gawain, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo. In 1925, he returned to Oxford University as a professor. To meet the teaching needs of women’s colleges, he provided private lessons. During his time at Oxford, he wrote the first two volumes of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Additionally, he published a philological article on Roman mythology.</p>

            <p>At the publisher's request for a sequel to The Hobbit, Tolkien began writing what would become his most famous work, The Lord of the Rings series. He worked on this project for ten years, starting in 1937 and continuing until 1947. He spent a considerable amount of time completing the main narrative and its appendices. During this process, he received significant support from his close friend, C.S. Lewis, the author of The Chronicles of Narnia. While The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings recount events that occur after those in The Silmarillion, they were written earlier in terms of chronology.</p>
